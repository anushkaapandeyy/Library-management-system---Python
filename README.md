# Library-management-system---Python
This Project was given to me during my training of Python with State Street Corporation as an intern.
I have used classes and objects to complete the task.
The .txt file has list of books you can add or delete.
The project has 4 modules -- 
                              1. ADD BOOKS
                              2. BORROW BOOKS
                              3. RETURN BOOKS
                              4. DISPLAY BOOKS
